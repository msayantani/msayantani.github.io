# Introduction to WBCS exam

This post is for absolute starters to the WBCS exams or in other words for people who are planning to start 
preparations for the exam. So for starters, this exam is primarily divided into the following 3 stages of selection :

* Stage 1 - Preliminary Exam
* Stage 2 - Main Exam
* Stage 3 - Personal Interview

Each of this stages is a screening stage. So people who can successfully clear `Stage 1` can only appear for `Stage 2` and 
similarly, people who can successfully clear `Stage 2` can only appear for `Stage 3`. So at each level , a vast percentage
of students get elimiated. So you can understand that the exam is immensely competitive and hence needs very good strategic
planning to succeed.

It is interesting to note that one's score in the first stage or the preliminary exam (popularly known as `preli` ) is 
not counted going forward. It is only used to filter out candidates who can appear for second stage which is the main exam.

However for main exam and personal interview (Stage 2 & 3 respectively), one's score is added up to finally ascertain 
whether he will be selected finally. This is of course provided one person is selected to appear both for Stage 2 & 3.

I would stop here for today and in the next blog - I'll discuss briefly about the patterns of Stage 1 (`preli`) exam. Till then looking forward to your questions..
